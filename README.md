###
Implement the possibility of sending notifications on each Borrowing creation
Set up a telegram chat for notifications posting in there
Set up a telegram bot for sending notifications
Investigate the `sendMessage` function interface in Telegram API
Make sure all private data is private, and never enters the GitHub repo (you can use the `python-dotenv` package for simple working with `.env` files. Make sure to add the `.env.sample` file with the `.env` content skeleton)
Create a helper for sending messages to the notifications chat through Telegram API
Integrate sending notifications on new borrowing creation (provide info about this borrowing in the message)
